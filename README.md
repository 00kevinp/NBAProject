## NBA Game Outcome Prediction


### Overview

This project predicts the outcome of NBA games using supervised machine learning trained on historical team statistics from the last 10 seasons (excluding the COVID-shortened 2019â€“2020 season). The system pulls historical data using the nba_api
 package, processes it with pandas, and trains a Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn to determine the winning team for any given matchup.

### Problem Statement

Can NBA game outcomes be accurately predicted using a supervised machine learning model trained on historical team data?
